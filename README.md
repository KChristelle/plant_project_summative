# Plant Growth Tracker

The proposed project is a plant care mobile application that will allow users to monitor their plants’ overall health growing around the house. Depending on each plant’s humidity, temperature, and nutritional needs, the application will provide instructions and custom notifications for how often a plant needs to be watered, fertilized, pruned, or taken closer to a window to obtain more sunlight.

## Prerequisites

This a flutter project and requires:
- Flutter running on your machine
- Any IDE of your choice
- Emulator or device to run the app

## Purpose of the Application

The plant tracker application has four main goals:

1. Educate the user: Users who own plants or want to purchase plants will have information about plant care all in one place. For example, the application will have information on how much light the plant needs, how often one should water it, or what type of fertilizer.
2. Resource management: The app will allow the user to plan effectively and provide water/fertilizer at the right time. 
3. Time management: The app will remind the user about when to take care of the plant(s).
4. Give users more choices: Once users have access to the types of plants, they can choose which is best suited. 

## How it works

Below is a brief overview of how the app works. The mobile application will:

1. Add plant species to the user’s list of plants with their image and name
2. Add desired reminders, for example, watering a plant 
3. Allow setting of desired watering frequency
4. Explore and recommend other plant species suitable for growing at home
5. Send push notifications on watering and overall health of the plant
6. Display graphs for soil moisture levels and the required amount of water for a plant
