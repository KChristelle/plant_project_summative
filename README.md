# Plant Growth Tracker

The proposed project is a plant care mobile application that will allow users to monitor their plants’ overall health growing around the house. Depending on each plant’s humidity, temperature, and nutritional needs, the application will provide instructions and custom notifications for how often a plant needs to be watered, fertilized, pruned, or taken closer to a window to obtain more sunlight.
